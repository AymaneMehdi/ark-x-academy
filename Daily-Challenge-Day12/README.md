<h1>Build a Contact List</h1>
Build a Node.js application that allows users to store and retrieve contacts. Each contact should have a name and a phone number. The application should provide the following functionalities:<br>
1 - Add a contact: Prompt the user to enter a name and phone number, then store it in a collection (e.g., an array or object).<br>
2 - View all contacts: Display a list of all the stored contacts, showing both the name and phone number.<br>
3 - Search for a contact: Prompt the user to enter a name and search for the contact in the collection. If found, display the name and phone number. If not found, display a message indicating that the contact was not found.<br>
4 - Exit the application: Allow the user to exit the application gracefully.

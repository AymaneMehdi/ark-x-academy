<h1>Blog App Backend</h1><br>
Creating a backend for a blog app using Node.js and Express, with JSON files as the storage method, is a great way to learn and apply various aspects of backend development including routing, middleware usage, and MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. Below is a challenge outline you can follow to build this blog app. The challenge is divided into several steps to guide you through the setup and development process.
You can build your project using Javascript   or Typescript for those who like to be challenged for further improvement.<br>
<h3>Challenge Overview</h3><br>
Develop a simple blog backend with the following features:<br><br>
* CRUD Operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete blog posts.<br>
* Persistence: Use a JSON file for data storage.<br>
* Middleware: Implement custom middleware for logging and error handling.<br>
<h3>Step 1: Project Setup</h3><br>
* Initialize a new Node.js project.<br>
* Install Express.<br>
* Install Nodemon for development.<br>
<h3>Step 2: Basic Server Setup</h3><br>
* Create an app.js file at the root of your project.<br>
* Set up a basic Express server in app.js.<br>
<h3>Step 3: Implement MVC Architecture</h3><br>
* Models: Create a models folder. Inside, create a post.js to define the structure of a blog post and functions to interact with the JSON file.<br>
* Views: For this backend challenge, views will not be utilized as we are focusing on the API. However, in a full MVC application, this would be where you'd manage templates and rendering.<br>
* Controllers: Create a controllers folder. Inside, create a postController.js file to handle the logic for CRUD operations.<br>
* Routes: Create a routes folder. Inside, define your routes in a postRoutes.js file and use Express Router.<br>
<h3>Step 4: Implement CRUD Operations</h3><br>
* In models/post.js, implement functions to read and write to a JSON file (e.g., getAllPosts, createPost, etc.).<br>
* In controllers/postController.js, use these model functions to handle requests and send responses.<br>
* Define routes in routes/postRoutes.js for each operation and link them to the appropriate controller functions.<br>
<h3>Step 5: Middleware</h3><br>
* Logging Middleware: Create middleware that logs each request to the console including the method and the path.<br>
* Error Handling Middleware: Implement error-handling middleware to catch and respond to any errors within your app.<br>
<h3>Step 6: Testing your Application</h3><br>
* Use Postman  to test each of your routes and ensure they perform the expected CRUD operations.<br>
* Test your middleware to ensure proper logging and error handling.<br>
<h3>Deliverables</h3><br>
* A GitHub repository containing your project code.<br>
* A README.md file documenting how to install, run, and test your application.<br><br>
This challenge will help you understand the basics of building a backend with Node.js and Express, using JSON for data storage, and implementing the MVC architecture. Good luck!<br><br>

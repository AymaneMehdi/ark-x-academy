<h1>Simple Math Operations</h1>
Now, it's time to validate our Node.js environment setup and our understanding of the Node.js by participating in a short challenge.<br>
Now, let's write a series of functions in a Node.js file that perform basic math operations. The functions should:<br>
1 - Add two numbers and return the result.<br>
2 - Subtract two numbers and return the result.<br>
3 - Multiply two numbers and return the result.<br>
4 - Divide two numbers and return the result.<br>
<h1>Instructions</h1>
1 - Create a new folder for your coding challenge files.<br>
2 - Open your preferred text editor or IDE.<br>
3 - Create a new file and save it with a ".js" extension. For example, you can name it "mathOperations.js".<br>
4 - Write the functions in the "mathOperations.js" file. Here's an example code:<br>
5 - Save the "mathOperations.js" file.<br>
6 - Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder containing the "mathOperations.js" file.<br>
7 - Run the command node mathOperations.js<br>
8 - Test the functions by calling them with sample inputs in the terminal.

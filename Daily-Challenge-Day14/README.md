<h1>Random City Temperature Display with File Operations</h>
In this challenge, we will build upon the previous "Random City Temperature Display" exercise and introduce file operations. The goal is to read the city name from a file named "input.txt," retrieve the weather data for the chosen city, and write the temperature result into a file with the city name as "cityname.txt". Before writing the result, you should delete any existing file for the chosen city.<br>
<h1>Requirements</h1><br>
1 - Read the city name from the "input.txt" file.<br>
2 - Retrieve the weather data for the chosen city.<br>
3 - Delete any existing file for the chosen city.<br>
4 - Write the temperature result into a new file named "cityname.txt".<br>
5 - Handle any errors that may occur during file operations, API requests, or other steps.
